Title:		Reboot
Tags:		blog

Today marks the official reboot of my personal blog, which has been on
the Internet sporadically since about 2002. I'm trying something
different this time, with content stored as static files in
[GitHub](https://github.com/knoxcarey/knoxcarey.com/tree/master/blog)
rather than in some other type of database that I would need to
maintain. Hopefully, this means that my posts will be a bit more
persistent. I have not quite settled on how to turn the static files
into web pages, but I am experimenting with different options.

As it is, my old blog posts are scattered all over the place. Some I
have in a very old SQL dump, some I have to recreate from caches on
the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/knoxcarey.com). I
will be porting over some of my old posts into the new format, so be
on the lookout for my Greatest Hits &mdash; some of them were even
read by other humans!
