      <h2>Affects Attendant on the Abiding<br/>Stage of Ignorance</h2>
      <div class="text">
	<p>
	  In Buddhist training, we speak of fifty-two stages, of which
	  one is a stage where the mind attaches itself to any object
	  it encounters. This attaching is known as <i>tomaru</i>,
	  "stopping" or "abiding." The mind stops with one object
	  instead of flowing from one object to another, as the mind
	  acts when it follows its own nature.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  In the case of swordsmanship, for instance, when the
	  opponent tries to strike you, your eyes at once catch the
	  movement of his sword and you may strive to follow it. But
	  as soon as this takes place, you cease to be master of
	  yourself and you are sure to be beaten. This is called
	  "stopping."
	</p>

	<p>
	  No doubt you see the sword about to strike you, but do not
	  let your mind stop there. Have no intention to
	  counterattack him in response to his threatening move,
	  cherish no calculating thoughts whatever. You simply
	  perceive the opponent's move, you do not allow your mind to
	  stop with it, you move on just as you are toward the
	  opponent and make use of his attack by turning it on to
	  himself. Then his sword meant to kill you will become your
	  own and the weapon will fall on the opponent himself.
	</p>

	<p>
	  This is "no sword" in your terminology. As soon as the mind
	  stops with an object of whatever nature &mdash; be it the
	  opponent's sword or your own, the man himself bent on
	  striking or the sword in his hand, the mode or the measure
	  of the move &mdash; you cease to be master of yourself and
	  are sure to fall victim to the enemy's sword. When you set
	  yourself against him, your mind will be carried away by
	  him. Therefore, do not even think of yourself. That is to
	  say, the opposition of subject and object is to be
	  transcended.
