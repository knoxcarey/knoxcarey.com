# Notes on Aikido

## Principles

### Get Out of the Way

There is a specific part of your body that is the target of an
attack. Sometimes you will intentionally offer the target,
drawing the attack to that point (cf. Drawing the Attack). Regardless
of whether the point of attack is known in advance or determined in
action, do not allow the target to be at the point of attack when it
lands.

### Where to Be

Where you can't be hit, but can control the situation.

### Drawing the Attack

An attacker will respond to an offered attack point, or, if not, will
have to deal with that point before they can continue their intended
attack. Attacks based on wrist grabs, etc often seem contrived, but if
you as nage offer your arm, then the attacker must (at a minimum)
get your arm out of the way before mounting their original attack. 

In drawing an attack it's important to make the attacker believe that
their attack will land, which means attention to timing (cf. Timing
under Attack). If you move too early, the attacker will "track" you,
and be able to complete their attack, at least partially. If you move
too late, you'll get hit. Move at the last possible moment to
get out of the way.

### Minimal Movement

Getting out of the way efficiently.

### Timing under Attack

### Do Not Contest the Point

### Awareness

You see the sword that kills you. Focus on hands stops mind.

### Hands in Front

Strong in front, weak on sides/behind.
Upper body like cylinder, with hands that can't slip around the sides.

### Know Your Degrees of Freedom

e.g. ryote dori -- can clap
e.g. kokyu ho -- can point fingers to your center
e.g. morote dori -- can drop elbow

### Balance

Third leg of tripod missing. Axis perpendicular to line between feet.

### Three "Centers"

1. perpendicular to pelvis
2. perpendicular to shoulders
3. direction of intention

### Ground

Push back foot into ground. 

### Center of the System

Two-body system -- where is the center? Need to make it you.

### Extension

Of your ki. Of Uke's body in an unbalancing direction. 

### Continue the Attack

Let attacker get away with his original intention. Lead, extend, redirect.

### Blend with the Attack

### Overcome Hard with Soft

Morote-dori kokyu ho -- elbow drop.

### Expansion and Contraction

Smoe techniques you draw inward towards the center, then explode outwards (e.g. Morote-dori kokyu ho). 

### Adopt Attacker's Point of View

Irimi-nage kokyu-ho.

### Leverage Over Power

esp. irimi nage (throw with hip rotation; make sure back foot moves in behind uke's feet)

esp. ikkyo, elbow below wrist.

### Power from Hips

Back foot. Rotational power. 

Project power by hip rotation. Create opening via hip rotation.

### Atemi Psychology

Draw a reaction -- uke wants to block/protect.

### Kiai Psychology

Startle response, creates tension in uke. 

### Kuzushi

Unbalance on first contact, and never let uke regain balance.

Counterexamples: standing up in the middle of a kote-gaeshi or nikkyo.

### Listening versus Talking

Your arms are for listening as much as talking. If you're shouting
(i.e. over-extended, using muscle) you can't listen effectively.
