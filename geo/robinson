      <h2>What is this Thing?</h2>
      <div class="text">
	<p>
	  The map above shows (in red) the locations of servers that
	  have tried to brute force my network, demonstrating
	  conclusively that this modest site is beloved the world
	  over. Entrance into this exclusive club can only be obtained
	  by attempting to ssh into my network more than five times in
	  a ten-second period. My personal best is once in a span of
	  about a minute. Keep trying kids, you'll get there! The blue
	  dots represent overly-aggressive web robots.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  My firewall captures offending IP address and places them on a
	  blocklist, which I periodically convert to geographic
	  information using the
	  excellent <a href="https://ipinfo.io">ipinfo.io</a>. The
	  JSON returned from that service looks like this:
	</p>

	<pre>
    {
      "ip": "103.89.88.95",
      "city": "Hanoi",
      "region": "Thanh Pho Ha Noi",
      "country": "VN",
      "loc": "21.0333,105.8500",
      "org": "AS135905 VIETNAM POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS GROUP"
    }</pre>

	<p>
	  I then draw dots on the map above using the loc fields for
	  each server.

      <h2>About the Map</h2>
      <div class="text">
	<p>
	  The map is
	  a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection">Robinson
	  projection</a> of the globe, designed by Dr Arthur Robinson to
	  produce an aesthetically pleasing representation.
	</p>

	<blockquote>
	  "I decided to go about it backwards," Dr. Robinson said. "I
	  started with a kind of artistic approach. I visualized the
	  best-looking shapes and sizes. I worked with the variables
	  until it got to the point where, if I changed one of them,
	  it didn't get any better. Then I figured out the
	  mathematical formula to produce that effect. Most mapmakers
	  start with the
	  mathematics."<br/><br/>

	<p>
	  Robinson <a href="http://www.radicalcartography.net/projections/robinsontable.html">tabulated</a>
	  the lengths of each parallel and its distance to the equator
	  in latitude increments of 5&deg;, with the expectation that
	  users would interpolate.
	</p>

	<p>That's what I have done to plot the server locations
	  above, using fourth-order polynomials fit with the
	  least squares method to Robinson's tabulated values.
	  To compute the length of a parallel given the latitude, use
	  the following polynomial coefficients:</p>
	
	<pre>[7.8334e-09, -1.3434e-06, 5.0267e-06, -5.2218e-04, 1.0007]</pre>

	<p>The distance of that parallel from the equator is given
	  by another polynomial with these coefficients:</p>

	<pre>[-4.1885e-09, 4.7268e-07, -1.8389e-05, 6.5366e-03, -5.7514e-04]</pre>

	<p>Lines of longitude are equally spaced along the
	  parallels. For more implementation details, see the page source.
