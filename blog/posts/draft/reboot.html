  <title>Reboot</title>

  <content>
    <p>Today marks the official reboot of my personal blog, which has been on
      the Internet sporadically since about 2002. I'm trying something
      different this time, with content stored as static files in
      <a href="https://github.com/knoxcarey">GitHub</a> rather than in some
      other type of database that I would need to maintain. Hopefully this
      means that my posts will be a bit more persistent. I have not quite
      settled on how to turn the static files into web pages, but I am
      experimenting with different options.</p>

    <p>As it is, my old blog posts are scattered all over the place. Some
      I have in a very old SQL dump, some I have to recreate from caches on
      the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/knoxcarey.com">Wayback
	Machine</a>. I will be porting over some of my old posts into the new
      format, so be on the lookout for my Greatest Hits &mdash; some of them
      were even read by other humans!</p>
